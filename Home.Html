		<p>MEEMURE VILLAGE CAMP offers guests an opportunity to experience what it is like to live in the ancient isolated village of Meemure. The village is situated deep in the Knuckles Wilderness, where the local people have maintained their traditional and cultural attitudes towards the forest’s existence. They rely heavily on the forest for their survival and gain as much as 63% of their total income from the forest resources. </p>
